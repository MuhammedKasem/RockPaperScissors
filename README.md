This project was created as a learning excercise for The Odin Project!

The Task:

- Creating a functioning Rock, Paper, Scissors game with javascript.
- Setting up a bot that would pick a random choice out of the 3 options was a requirement.
- The game needed to have some sort of function to get user input.
- The game needed certain conditionals in order to check the users response and compare it to the bot.

My Thoughts:

- All in all, the assignment wasnt too hard to complete and the curriculum provided me with all the tools I needed
  in order to solve this assignment.
- I learned to differentiate between conditionals and decide for myself which tool is best fit for each task.
- Overall, I had a great experience programming this simple game and I plan on returning to it and adding UI later!
